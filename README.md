My name is Jade Bedlington and I am from Ontario, Canada. I have always been interested in computers and technology. Growing up I would always want to edit videos and dive into the technical aspect of everything. After completing my computer programming course, I realized I am very interested in websites and designing them specifically. I am happy to say, I am very excited to move forward in the workspace within that field. During my Computer Programming course, I worked with the following:
